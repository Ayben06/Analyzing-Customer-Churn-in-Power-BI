# Analyzing-Customer-Churn-in-Power-BI

## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer churn for a fictitious Telecom provider, **Databel**. By examining a dataset that simulates customer behaviors, we seek to uncover the underlying reasons for customer attrition and identify patterns that can help in developing strategies to retain customers.

## The Problem

- **Solving Customer Churn:** Understanding the reasons behind customer churn is crucial for maintaining a healthy business.
- **Dataset Overview:** The analysis utilizes a fictitious dataset from Databel, a Telecom provider, to explore customer churn dynamics.
- **Key Objective:** Discover the factors contributing to customer churn and implement actionable insights.

## Defining Churn

Churn rate, often referred to as the rate of attrition or customer churn, quantifies the rate at which customers cease their relationship with a company. 

- **Leaky Bucket Problem:** This concept illustrates the challenge of retaining customers against the constant loss of existing ones.
- **Customer Retention Priority:** It is generally easier and more cost-effective to retain current customers than to acquire new ones. Thus, reducing churn is a priority for many businesses.
